# MUHAS Elective Study: "Application of the State-of-the-Art Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in Detecting Cervical Pre-Cancerous Lesions by Using Public Available Pap Smear Cytological Images"

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my elective study conducted at the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) in Tanzania. This study focuses on the "Application of the State-of-the-Art Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in Detecting Cervical Pre-Cancerous Lesions by Using Publicly Available Pap Smear Cytological Images."

## Overview

Cervical cancer remains a significant public health issue, especially in under-resourced settings. Early detection through screening can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. This project explores the potential of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of detecting pre-cancerous lesions in cervical cells using cytological images from Pap smears.

## Objectives

- To evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art AI algorithms in the classification of Pap smear images.
- To assess the potential of these AI models to assist pathologists and reduce the workload in resource-limited settings.
- To contribute to the global efforts in cervical cancer screening and prevention by providing an open-source tool for researchers and clinicians.

## Dataset

The study utilizes publicly available datasets of Pap smear cytological images. The specific datasets used include:
- [Dataset Name 1]: Description and link
- [Dataset Name 2]: Description and link
(Replace the placeholders with actual dataset names, descriptions, and links.)

## Methodology

The study employs several advanced AI models, including but not limited to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning frameworks, to analyze and classify cytological images. The methodology section details the preprocessing steps, model architectures, training processes, and evaluation metrics used in the study.

## Results

This section presents the findings of the study, including model performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. A comparative analysis of the different AI models used is also provided.
